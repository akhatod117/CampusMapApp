# CavMap (Team A-01)

This application can map the various locations UVA students need to get to all their classes.
There are 4 tabs, each providing a feature of our app.

The main page displays your username and provides the weather at your current location, useful if you plan on going outside following the instructions of the map.

The 'Map' Tab: Provides a generic map where your current location is already inputted, simply type in the destination and you can get directions from your location to that destination.

The 'Route Maker' Tab: Allows students to put any location in Charlottesville that is visible on a map (i.e. Thornton Hall) and provide chronological routing from your current location to all locations inputted. It will display a map that has your current location marked as A and your final location marked as B. The intermediate locations are shown as waypoint markers. Students can also re-generate their last saved route with the click of a button. 

The 'Forum' Tab: This is a place where all students can provide each other with updates about things happening on Grounds (i.e. if a certain road is closed or congested, or if a certain restaurant is closed, etc.)

The 'Create Post' Tab: This is where students can create their post to publish on Forum. Their names are automatically registered as the author

The 'Logout' Tab: Logs out user of the current app. Must log in again to access the application's features.
